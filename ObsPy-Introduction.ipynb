    "<p>During this introduction we will look at some seismic data from April 17, 2012 because there were some sizable earthquakes on that date.  ObsPy has many different tools that are helpful to seismologists.  We will start with one of the most basic (and most important), handling date and time information.  It does not take long as a seismologist to get frustrated with how many datasets and software represent date and time information with different formats.  I would guess some of you have been a little bothered with how precise the FetchEvent format is, and then the format for other commands want a different, but still precise, format.  ObsPy has created the UTCDateTime() function to help with this.  Take a minute to have a look at the manual for this function:</p> <p><a href=https://docs.obspy.org/packages/autogen/obspy.core.utcdatetime.UTCDateTime.html>https://docs.obspy.org/packages/autogen/obspy.core.utcdatetime.UTCDateTime.html</a></p> <p>As you can quickly see, this function is helpful for converting between many different date and time formats.

The output of a correct command should be midnight on the beginning of January 1, 1970.  reveals that when given a number, UTCDateTime interprets it as so-called \"epoch time\".  This is the number of seconds since the beginning of 1970.  Although that might seem very arbitrary, it has to do with the history of when the Unix operating system was created (note that Linux is an open source version of Unix).  Much like when it was created, the epoch time is a very useful way to do math on date and time information since it is a single number instead of a combination of numbers (year, month, day, hour, minute, second) with special conditions (i.e., minutes only go up to a value of 60 before incrementing the hour category). </p><p>For example, what number (instead of zero) can we input into the UTCDateTime function to go exactly one day into the future from the epoch time represented by zero?
